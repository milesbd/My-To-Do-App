    <h2>Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>
      We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the
      European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we
      are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how
      we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in
      the wrong way.
    </p>

    <h2>What is GDPR?</h2>
    <p>
      GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU
      residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU
      residents have, over their personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the
      EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers' data is important
      irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented
      GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.
    </p>

    <h2>What is personal data?</h2>
    <p>
      Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR
      covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or
      in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person.
      Personal data extends beyond a person's name or email address. Some
      examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data,
      biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and
      ethnicity.
    </p>
    <p>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and
        transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would
        reasonably expect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and
        it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why
        they need the personal data when they collect it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its
        purpose.
      </li>
      <li>
        People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal
        data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be
        updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why is GDPR important?</h2>
    <p>
      GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect
      individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises
      the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater
      fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At
      My To Do App we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important
      and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go
      beyond the requirements of this new regulation.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion
    </h2>
    <p>
      We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights
      requirements of GDPR. While My To Do App does not process or store any
      personal data, we do you may contact us with any GDPR data requests.
